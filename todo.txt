bugs:
// removing a number from cart messes up number in stock (wrong fn called? reducer issue?)
// fix the count/number on each item when "buying" (and reset to zero after submitting)
// show correct amount they add to cart in the item (in cart route)
// need to do slice/blabla to keep item in same spot (when adding to cart, it moves to the end...)

// allow people ("admins") to add stock (items) to the store (with image!)
// fix images
// in item (when in cart), update so button says "update item count" (or similar), and use that submitted value to update amt in cart (or remove if user enters 0)
