bugs:
// fix images on cart page, or after they are added to cart (they lose the imgSrc prop...)
// make sure stock can't go negative?? or once it is negative, don't let more people put that item in cart
// show correct amount they add to cart in the item (in cart route)
// need to do slice/blabla to keep item in same spot (when adding to cart, it moves to the end...)
// currently you can keep "removing" an item from cart infinitely (in effect adding more stock for that item)

// allow people ("admins") to add stock (items) to the store (with image!)
// in item (when in cart), update so button says "update item count" (or similar), and use that submitted value to update amt in cart (or remove if user enters 0)


bugs fixed:
// removing a number from cart messes up number in stock (wrong fn called? reducer issue?)
// fix the count/number on each item when "buying" (and reset to zero after submitting)




TODOS:
reimplement configure store (for testing)
addNewItemsToCart(stock) method/action
use static proptypes
tests - test sagas
      - test components

dompurify/joi inputs
styled components
immutable


DONE:
-- eslint
-- sagas
