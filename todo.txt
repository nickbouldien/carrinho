bugs:
// fix the count/number on each item when "buying" (and reset to zero after submitting)

// need to do slice/blabla to keep item in same spot (when adding to cart, it moves to the end...)

// allow people to add stock (items) to the store

// in item (when in cart), update so button says "update item count" (or similar), and use that submitted value to update amt in cart (or remove if user enters 0)
